<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Project focused in helping elderly people on improving their skills suchs as memory, lenguaje, attention etc. There are a variety of game tasks to complete for each skill. All scores are record to check it their improvements. Initially it was going to be a project for the university, of social education career that was not going to take place, remaining in a theoretical framework, but I decided to collaborate and create the application that they had proposed in that project.

The visual part is everything done, games part is needed to continue developing but rigth now im working on others projects. If Im able, I will continue developing it.
